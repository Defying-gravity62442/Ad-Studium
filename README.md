# Ad Studium

> *Your AI companion for the PhD journey*

**Ad Studium** is a sophisticated reflection and preparation platform built specifically for future PhD students. Unlike general-purpose AI tools, every feature serves one ultimate goal: helping you develop the skills, mindset, and preparation needed for successful PhD applications and research careers.

Built by an undergraduate student for fellow PhD aspirants who understand that the journey to graduate school requires deep thinking, long-term planning, and sustained motivation.

## üéØ Why Ad Studium?

**The Problem**: Generic AI tools treat every conversation as a "new chat." Your breakthrough from six months ago is forgotten, your reading insights exist in isolation, and your research goals remain disconnected from daily activities.

**The Solution**: A companion that grows with you. Every journal entry, reading reflection, and roadmap becomes part of your evolving story. The longer you use it, the better it understands your research journey.

### Key Differentiators

- **Contextual Memory**: Hierarchical summary system remembers your breakthroughs across months and years
- **Single Purpose**: Every feature designed specifically for PhD preparation‚Äîno distractions
- **Personal Companion**: Customize your AI's name and personality; this feels like texting a brilliant research friend
- **Research Integration**: Real-time academic data via Perplexity API ensures current, accurate information
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Your personal data is encrypted with keys only you control

## ‚ú® Features

### üß† Deep Reading Reflection
Move beyond PDF summarization. Our RAG-powered system asks Socratic questions that challenge your understanding and provides cross-contextual insights connecting your readings to broader research goals.

### üó∫Ô∏è Research-Powered Roadmaps
Transform ambitious goals into actionable steps. Whether it's PhD applications, developing lab skills, or building professor relationships, our Perplexity integration ensures roadmaps use the latest academic information.

### üí≠ Contextual Journaling
Your daily reflections become part of a growing narrative. Our hierarchical summary system ensures your AI companion remembers significant moments and can reference them months later during crucial decisions.

### üìÆ Letters to Future Self
Write time-capsule letters that unseal at perfect moments. Celebrate milestones, reflect on growth, and find motivation exactly when you need it most on the long PhD preparation journey.

### ü§ù Your Research Companion
Name your AI, customize their personality, and build a relationship that evolves. The UI deliberately avoids words like "generate" and "AI"‚Äîthis is about companionship, not automation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.4.5, React 19.1.0, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js 4.24.11 with Google OAuth
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma 6.13.0 ORM
- **AI Integration**: 
  - Anthropic Claude (via Amazon Bedrock) for conversational AI
  - Perplexity API for real-time research data
  - Amazon Titan for PDF embeddings and RAG functionality
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption for all user data
- **PDF Processing**: PDF.js for client-side PDF parsing
- **Deployment**: Vercel-ready with self-hosting options

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database
- Google OAuth credentials
- API keys for Amazon Bedrock (Claude), Perplexity, and Amazon Titan

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ad-studium.git
   cd ad-studium
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Configure the following variables:
   ```env
   # Database
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/ad_studium"
   
   # NextAuth
   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
   
   # Google OAuth
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
   
   # AI APIs
   AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK="your-aws-bedrock-token"
   BEDROCK_INFERENCE_PROFILE_ID="your-bedrock-profile-id"
   AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
   PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your-perplexity-api-key"
   ```
   
   **Note**: The current implementation uses Amazon Bedrock for Claude access. If you prefer to use other LLM providers (like direct Anthropic API, OpenAI, etc.), you'll need to modify the AI integration files in `src/lib/ai/`.

4. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   npx prisma generate
   ```

5. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
