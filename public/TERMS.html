        <p><strong>Content Monitoring Limitations:</strong> Due to end-to-end encryption, I cannot access, view, or monitor your personal content (journals, goals, uploaded documents). While you agree not to upload prohibited content, technical enforcement is limited. Third-party AI and calendar providers may have access to content you choose to share with them during feature usage.</p>

        <li>For data retention by third-party AI and calendar providers, review their respective privacy policies</li>
