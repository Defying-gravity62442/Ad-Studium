<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 3rd, 2025</p>

<div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Ad Studium is a personal open-source project created by an undergraduate student to help fellow undergraduates planning graduate school. This service is provided completely free of charge.</p>
</div>

<p>Welcome to Ad Studium. This Privacy Policy explains how Ad Studium, operated by Heming Gao ("I," "me," or "the operator"), collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Ad Studium application (the "App"). I am committed to protecting your privacy through end-to-end encryption and data minimization principles.</p>

<p>The App integrates with third-party Artificial Intelligence (AI) services to provide enhanced functionality. By using the App, you acknowledge and agree that certain data will be processed as outlined in this policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please discontinue use of the App.</p>

<div class="privacy-summary">
    <h2>Privacy at a Glance</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What I Collect:</strong> Google account information for authentication, your encrypted content (journals, goals, uploaded PDFs), calendar data (with permission), and interaction data for AI features.</li>
        <li><strong>How I Use It:</strong> Your data powers the App's core services including Roadmap planning, Journal functionality, and Reading Reflection features.</li>
        <li><strong>Who I Share It With:</strong> AI service providers (Perplexity, Anthropic, Amazon) receive necessary data to provide services. Calendar providers receive data for calendar integration. <strong>Personal data is never sold.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Your content is stored with end-to-end encryption. For Reading Reflection PDFs, we store numerical embeddings (unencrypted for RAG functionality) that cannot be reversed to original text, with user-to-document mappings encrypted for privacy.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Processing:</strong> When using AI features, content is decrypted <strong>on your device</strong> and sent to third-party providers through our server, which acts as a secure relay without logging or storing decrypted content.</li>
        <li><strong>Your Control:</strong> Export your data, delete content (with cooling-off periods for journals and daily summaries), or permanently delete your account and all data at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>No Backups:</strong> We do not maintain backups. When you delete data or your account, deletion is immediate and permanent.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

</ul>

<h3>1.5 Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
<ul>
    <li>IP addresses or device information</li>
    <li>Usage analytics or tracking data</li>
    <li>Browsing history or third-party app data</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Core App Operation:</strong> Maintain accounts, sync data, and provide basic functionality</li>
    <li><strong>AI-Powered Features:</strong> Enable Roadmap planning, Journal insights, and Reading Reflection analysis</li>
    <li><strong>Calendar Integration:</strong> Sync and manage calendar events when requested</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Authenticate users and maintain secure sessions</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
<p><strong>Your personal information is never sold.</strong> Data is shared only when necessary to provide services:</p>

<h3>3.1 AI Service Providers</h3>
<ul>

    <li><strong>Anthropic Claude (via Amazon Bedrock):</strong> Processes content for roadmap planning, journaling assistance, and reading reflection analysis</li>
    <li><strong>Amazon Titan:</strong> Generates numerical embeddings from uploaded PDFs for Reading Reflection features</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.2 Calendar Providers</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Google Calendar or other connected services receive data only for calendar events you create or modify</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3 Third-Party Privacy Policies</h3>
<ul>
    <li>AI service providers (Perplexity, Anthropic, Amazon) have their own privacy policies governing how they handle data sent to them</li>
    <li>Calendar providers (Google Calendar, etc.) have their own privacy policies for calendar integration</li>
    <li><strong>Your Responsibility:</strong> Please review the privacy policies of these third-party services to understand their data practices</li>

<h2>4. Data Security and Encryption</h2>

<h3>4.1 End-to-End Encryption</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Your journal entries, daily summaries, goals, and personal content are encrypted at rest</li>

    <li>Even the operator cannot access your encrypted content</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.2 Reading Reflection PDF Handling</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Uploaded PDFs:</strong> Converted to numerical embeddings (mathematical representations) using Amazon Titan</li>
    <li><strong>Embeddings Storage:</strong> These numerical vectors are stored unencrypted to enable RAG functionality, but cannot be reversed to recover original text</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> The mapping between your user ID and document IDs is end-to-end encrypted, so the operator cannot link users to their uploaded documents</li>
    <li><strong>Content Analysis:</strong> While embeddings might reveal general topics about document content, the specific original text cannot be recovered from the embeddings</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.3 AI and Calendar Data Processing</h3>
<ol>
    <li>You initiate a request requiring external services</li>
    <li>Relevant content is decrypted <strong>locally on your device</strong></li>
    <li>Decrypted data is sent via TLS encryption to our server</li>
    <li>Our server forwards the data to the appropriate third-party provider <strong>without storing, logging, or caching it</strong></li>
    <li>Responses are relayed back to your device through the same secure process</li>
</ol>

<h3>4.4 Data in Transit</h3>
